Create a Java class
Create a method for Wikipedia Search
Add @Test annotation for Wikipedia search method
Also Add below code in the same java class
@BeforeMethod
public void sample1(){
  Sysout.out.println("This is sample1 method and used @BeforeMethod Annottaion");
}
@AfterMethod
public void sample2(){
  Sysout.out.println("This is sample1 method and used @AfterMethod Annottaion");
}
